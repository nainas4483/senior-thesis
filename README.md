# **Machine Learning Models Accurately Predict Polar Sea Surface Salinity**

## **Abstract**
The ocean makes up about 71\% of the Earthâ€™s surface, with roughly 9\% of that covered by sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. However, this coverage is decreasing, likely due to anthropogenic climate change. One important factor in the forming and melting of sea ice, and thus models of future ice extent, is the salinity of the polar oceans. There has been a historical difficulty in obtaining accurate salinity measurements in polar regions due to a sparsity of in-situ measuring apparatus and low sensitivities of satellites to the properties of colder waters. Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown consistent accuracy in measuring global ocean salinity, however they have not yet addressed polar regions specifically. Through the use of five ML methods, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), this study shows that ML can be used to provide accurate measurements of salinities in polar regions, with Random Forest displaying the highest accuracy (when compared with in-situ data). These measurements can then be used to fill in gaps in various ocean and climate models.
