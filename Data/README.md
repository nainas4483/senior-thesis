# **Data**

## **Sources**
**Argo Float Data**\
This dataset includes sea surface salinity, temperature, and pressure. It is derived from in-situ measurements made by the Argo Floats. Data was downloaded from the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE). It is split by ocean so only Atlantic and Pacific ocean data was downloaded.

Argo Float Program, Argo. Available as NetCDF through US Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment.

**NOAA Optimum Interpolation SST**\
This dataset includes sea ice concentration. It is a collection of data from satellites, ships and Argo Floats, interpolated to fill in any gaps in the global grid.

**NOAA CoastWatch**\
This dataset includes wind speed. It combines multiple satellites to construct data of sea surface wind speed.

**GPM IMERG Early Precipitation**\
This dataset includes precipitation. It combines data from the TRMM satellite (2000-2015) with data from the GPM satellite (2014-present) to get estimates of global precipitation per grid cell.
